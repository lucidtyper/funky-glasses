# funky-glasses
WIP (starting on 15th June) lightweight app for quick switching between modes and if possible show all of the ones not appearing in the original app.

## What I'm planning to do
For this I'll start analyzing with Wireshark or other means the connection between my Android phone and the led glasses and recreate the bluetooth commands between both devices.
Yet I still don't know which framework/language I'm going to use, the app will be a lightweight app, everything may will be kept under one or two activities (no need to be swiping to select the mode of the display for example).

## Hardware reference
- **Name on the box**: _Magic LED Eyeglasses_
- **Name of the app (Android)**: _Funky Glasses_

## Possible future references (probably not the same model as the one I have, since they are a copy).
