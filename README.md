# funky-glasses
WIP (starting on 15th June) lightweight app for quick switching between modes and if possible show all of the ones not appearing in the original app.

## Hardware reference
- **Name on the box**: _Magic LED Eyeglasses_
- **Name of the app (Android)**: _Funky Glasses_

## Possible future references (probably not the same model as the one I have, since they are a copy).
